# Prop Hunt GUI

Prop Hunt is a custom game mode for [Cube 2: Sauerbraten](http://sauerbraten.org/), a free, open source, Quake-like arena FPS.

The prophunt.cfg in this repository will enable you to quickly choose props while on a Prop Hunt server.

# Installation

- Download [prophunt.cfg](prophunt.cfg)
- Put prophunt.cfg into your Sauerbraten home directory
- Open your autoexec.cfg, either from your home directory or ingame (options -> cfg -> autoexec.cfg editor)
- enter `exec prophunt.cfg` into a seperate line of your autoexec
- Save, close and restart Sauerbraten

# Usage

If you're on the server, you can access the GUI with ```/showgui prophunt```.

It is recommended that you bind this command to a key for quick access, e.g. ```/bind F3 [showgui prophunt]```

After this, browse through a sorted list of models and click the images to change them instead of endlessly scrolling.

Have fun :)
